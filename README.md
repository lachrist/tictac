# TicTac

This is a simple HTML page that I use to time my swimmers but I guess it can be used in other discplines as well.
Times are output in a textareas with a format optimized for copy pasting into spreadsheets.
You can access this tool online using [rawgit](http://rawgit.com/lachrist/tictac/master/tictac.html) or download the HTML file and use it locally.
The page should work on all major browsers.
