# TicTac

This is a simple HTML page that I use to time my swimmers.
Times are output in a textarea and are separated by tabulations which ease copy pasting into spreadsheets. 
You can access this project online using [rawgit](http://rawgit.com/lachrist/tictac/master/tictac.html) or download the file and use it locally.
The page should work on all major browsers.
